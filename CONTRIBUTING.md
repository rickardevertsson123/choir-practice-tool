Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project.

How to contribute
- Fork the repository and open a pull request with a clear description of the change.
- Keep PRs small and focused (one feature or bugfix per PR).
- Run `npm install` and `npm run dev` locally and ensure there are no TypeScript or lint errors.

Code of conduct
- Be respectful and constructive. This is an informal project; contributions are welcome.

Licensing and commercial use
- The project is distributed under the GNU General Public License v2 (GPLv2).
- If you want to use this project in a commercial/proprietary setting without complying
  with the GPLv2 terms, a commercial license for the author's original code can be
  negotiated. Contact: babylonwizards@gmail.com

Important notes about third-party code
- This repository depends on third-party libraries (see `package.json`). Those
  libraries keep their own licenses (for example: MIT for many frontend libs).
- Any commercial licensing you negotiate only covers the parts you own. Third-party
  dependencies will remain under their original licenses and may impose separate
  obligations.
